## Description

This application was created as a homework assignment for the MSU Coding Bootcamp. The challenge was to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. I used Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the Express.js and Mongoose packages, I also used a JavaScript date library of your choice or the native JavaScript Date object to format timestamps.
